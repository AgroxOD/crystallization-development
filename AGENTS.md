# Repository Guidelines

- Update `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and this `AGENTS.md` with each pull request.
- Use `npm run crystal:avg` to verify crystallization level when possible.
- Keep the badge in `README.md` up to date using the result of `npm run crystal:avg`.
- Use `npm run crystal:update-badge` to automatically refresh the README badge.
- Encourage new CLI implementations in `cli-implementations/` for other languages.
- A minimal Bash script is available as an experimental example.
- New command `list-funcs` scans repository functions once and stores the most common result in `most_common_function.txt`.
- New command `list-diamonds` lists all tasks with `diamond` status.
- `crystal:sync` keeps `crystallization.json` synchronized between the repo and `.vscode` for IDE integration.
- Diamond rule: tasks reaching all KPI thresholds get `diamond` status.
- Use `crystal:init` to "crystallize" any repository with a starter `crystallization.json`.
- Use `create_env_from_exports.sh` to generate a `.env` file when environment exports are required.
- Refer to `CRYSTALLIZATION_PROTOCOL.md` for the official specification.
- This PR demonstrates a 10-iteration improvement loop with KPI tracking.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing changes.
- Commit messages should follow the Conventional Commits style; commitlint will enforce it.
- Keep `package-lock.json` synced with `package.json` by running `npm install` whenever dependencies change.
- See `docs/future_recommendations_ru.md` for long-term ideas.
- Repository now crystallized to 100%; maintain level above 95%.
